   - `Ctrl+N`: New file
   - `Ctrl+O`: Open file
   - `Ctrl+S`: Save file
   - `Ctrl+E`: Toggle view mode

2. **Unsaved Changes**: The editor shows a dot (‚Ä¢) next to the filename when you have unsaved changes

3. **Dark Mode**: The editor automatically adapts to your system's dark mode preference

4. **Code Highlighting**: Code blocks automatically detect the language and apply syntax highlighting

5. **Live Preview Editing**: In preview mode, you can edit text directly by clicking on it. The markdown source is automatically updated.

## Troubleshooting

- Refresh the view by switching modes twice
- Check the browser console for errors (F12 in dev mode)
